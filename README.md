# CalamityCall

CalamityCall is a collaborative disaster-response application designed to support *emergency alerting, event tracking, and rapid communications*. This project combines **Java** and **Python** components to create a hybrid system capable of backend logic, integration services, and user-facing functionality.

This repository contains the core application code, dependencies, workflows, and release artifacts — all structured to demonstrate a real-world software project built by a cross-disciplinary team.

## 🧠 What CalamityCall Does

At its core, CalamityCall enables:

- **Alert generation and dispatch** for critical events  
- **Real-time or near-real-time communications** during emergencies or incidents
- Integration between backend services and client components  
- Acalability for future features

Because it mixes Java and Python, this project can scale across service tiers while having maintainable, modular code.
